## Run Demo

After installation, you can run the demo application with the following commands. Note that running the demo requires a Qt environment (like PySide2 or PyQt5):

```shell
# Run as a Python module (requires PySide2 or PyQt5 to be installed)
python -m dayu_widgets

# Or use the uvx command line tool (recommended, handles dependencies automatically)
uvx --python 3.10 --with pyside2 dayu_widgets
```

> **Note**: dayu_widgets is a Qt UI library, so running the demo requires a Qt environment. When using the `uvx` command, you can automatically handle Qt dependencies with the `--with pyside2` parameter.

```python
import dayu_widgets
